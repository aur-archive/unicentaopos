uniCenta oPOS v3.55
Date: 26 October 2013 @ 00:00


************  Important Notice ******************

This version replaces previous 3.50 versions - it is now deprecated.
In other words it wasn't a good release.

uniCenta oPOS will detect and upgrade versions 3.02 and 3.50
 
Earlier 2.80 version will upgrade but you will receive some errors due to missing table fields.
You will need to detect and fix the missing fields manually.

If you are installing on a Mac.
uniCenta oPOS will run on a MAC and has been tested with OSX 10.8.5 and Java 7.45 JRE
Please visit Apple and Java sites to ensure you follow their guidance for the correct OS and Java versions and these are installed correctly before running uniCenta oPOS install.
All uniCenta oPOS files are in one folder and if you're comfortable with copying files then
simply copy them out of the installer package (Inspect Contents) and into a folder of your choosing.
You can then run the unicentaopos.jar directly.

If you are installing on Linux
I can only test up to a point with Linux - which may not surface some install issues
